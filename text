why does my background not change when i execute this subrutiene ?
the only thing in my clipboard is exactly 6A9955

SetBackGround:
		clipboardContent := Clipboard
		Gui, Color, clipboardContent ; Set GUI background color	
		MsgBox, %Clipboard% %clipboardContent%
	return


the following line is at the biggining of my gui creation and works when i change the color to 6A9955

Gui, Color, FFFFFF ; Set GUI background color to white
